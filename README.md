## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good project for me to increase my speed in writing out my CSS. It helped me find some areas that I still am slow at remembering so that I can focus my studies a bit narrower.

### Continued development

I want to start building projects that incorporate the components of the mini projects that I have been doing.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me figure out quick solutions when I got stuck. It was a great reference page to keep open through the design process.
